C recursions.
recursions are defined as functions that solve problems by using smaller or broken down versions of the main problem.
per my ununderstanding, recursions work like swings that collects data of miniature versions of a problem and return by the same route. but this time, it is using the data collected to solve the minute problems from the most minute to the main problem.

this directory will contain solutions to tasks to help better understand C recursions.
