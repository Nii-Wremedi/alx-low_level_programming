A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head node, and the last node is called the tail node, which has a null pointer as its next node.

Each node in the list contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
The pointer to the next node is represented by an arrow pointing to the next node in the sequence.

To traverse a singly linked list, you start at the head node and follow the next pointers from node to node until you reach the tail node.
This is called a linear search. Singly linked lists are efficient for inserting and deleting nodes at the beginning of the list, but not as efficient for inserting or deleting nodes in the middle or at the end of the list.

Singly linked lists are commonly used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types, as well as in many computer algorithms and applications.

In C programming, singly linked lists are typically implemented using a struct that contains a value and a pointer to the next node, as shown in the format provided in your initial message.
