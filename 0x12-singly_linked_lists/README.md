# Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the implementation and usage of singly linked lists. The programs are part of the low-level programming curriculum at ALX - Holberton School.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler
- `gcc` command with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` flags

## Usage

To compile the programs, run the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the desired source file and `<output_file>` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

## Programs

### 0-print_list.c

This program demonstrates the printing of all elements in a `list_t` linked list.

Usage:
```
./a.out
```

### 1-list_len.c

This program counts the number of elements in a `list_t` linked list.

Usage:
```
./a.out
```

### 2-add_node.c

This program adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` linked list.

Usage:
```
./a.out
```

### 3-add_node_end.c

This program adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` linked list.

Usage:
```
./a.out
```
