More of C programing.

today we're looking at the fuinctions malloc and free.
"malloc" is usued to allocate a certain amount of memory during the exercution of a program. it will request a block of memory from the heap, if the request is granted, the O.S will reserve th amount requested and the malloc will return a pointer to the reserved space.

when the amount of memory requested is no longer needed, the "free" function is used to return the reserved momory back to the O.S
