C preprocessors.

these are derevatives that run before compilation of C program. 
They provide textual replacemnet of soure code.
They start with the '#' character and are used to provide infomation to the preprocessor.

SOME COMMON PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS INCLUDE:

1. #define: This preprocessor function is used to define a macro. It creates a symbolic name for a constant or an expression, which can then be used in the code as a substitute for the actual value.
2. #include: This preprocessor function is used to include the contents of another file in the current source code file. The included file can be either a system header file or a user-defined header file.
3. #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif: These preprocessor functions are used to conditionally include or exclude parts of the code based on whether a certain macro is defined or not.
4. #pragma: This preprocessor function is used to provide additional instructions to the compiler about how to handle the code.
5. #error: This preprocessor function is used to generate an error message during the compilation process if a certain condition is met.

Overall, preprocessor functions are used to provide a way to manipulate the source code before it is compiled. They are powerful tools that can be used to customize and optimize the code, but they should be used with caution, as they can also make the code harder to read and understand.
